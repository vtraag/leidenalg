class MutableVertexPartition(_ig.VertexClustering):
  """ Contains a partition of graph, derives from :class:`ig.VertexClustering`.

  This class contains the basic implementation for optimising a partition.
  Specifically, it implements all the administration necessary to keep track of
  the partition from various points of view. Internally, it keeps track of the
  number of internal edges (or total weight), the size of the communities, the
  total incoming degree (or weight) for a community, et cetera.

  In order to keep the administration up-to-date, all changes in a partition
  should be done through
  :func:`~VertexPartition.MutableVertexPartition.move_node` or
  :func:`~VertexPartition.MutableVertexPartition.set_membership`.  The first
  moves a node from one community to another, and updates the administration.
  The latter simply updates the membership vector and updates the
  administration.

  The basic idea is that
  :func:`~VertexPartition.MutableVertexPartition.diff_move` computes the
  difference in the quality function if we would call
  :func:`~VertexPartition.MutableVertexPartition.move_node` for the same move.
  These functions are overridden in any derived classes to provide an actual
  implementation. These functions are used by :class:`Optimiser` to optimise
  the partition.

               derived classes provide an actual implementation.

  The quality function is

  where :math:`A` is the adjacency matrix, :math:`k_i` is the (weighted) degree

  :math:`\\delta(\\sigma_i, \\sigma_j) = 1` if :math:`\\sigma_i = \\sigma_j`

  This can alternatively be formulated as a sum over communities:

  .. math:: Q = \\sum_{c} \\left(m_c - \\gamma \\frac{K_c^2}{4m} \\right)

  where :math:`m_c` is the number of internal edges (or total internal edge
  weight) of community :math:`c` and :math:`K_c = \\sum_{i \\mid \\sigma_i = c}
  k_i` is the total (weighted) degree of nodes in community :math:`c`.

  Note that for directed graphs a slightly different formulation is used, as
  proposed by Leicht and Newman [2]:

  .. math:: Q = \\sum_{ij} \\left(A_{ij} - \\gamma \\frac{k_i^\mathrm{out} k_j^\mathrm{in}}{m} \\right)\\delta(\\sigma_i, \\sigma_j),

  where :math:`k_i^\\mathrm{out}` and :math:`k_i^\\mathrm{in}` refers to
  respectively the outdegree and indegree of node :math:`i`, and :math:`A_{ij}`
  refers to an edge from :math:`i` to :math:`j`.

  Note that this is the same as :class:`ModularityVertexPartition` when setting
  :math:`\\gamma=1` and normalising by :math:`2m`, or :math:`m` for directed
  graphs.

  where :math:`m_c` is the number of internal edges of community :math:`c` and
  :math:`n_c` the number of nodes in community :math:`c`.

  The resolution parameter :math:`\\gamma` for this functions has a
  particularly simple interpretation. The internal density of communities

  .. math:: p_c = \\frac{m_c}{\\binom{n_c}{2}} \\geq \\gamma

  is higher than :math:`\\gamma`, while the external density

  .. math:: p_{cd} = \\frac{m_{cd}}{n_c n_d} \\leq \\gamma

  is lower than :math:`\\gamma`. In other words, choosing a particular
  :math:`\\gamma` corresponds to choosing to find communities of a particular
  density, and as such defines communities. Finally, the definition of a
  community is in a sense independent of the actual graph, which is not the
  case for any of the other methods (see the reference for more detail).

    Notes
    -----

    For bipartite networks, we would like to be able to set three different
    resolution parameters: one for within each class :math:`\\gamma_0,
    \\gamma_1`, and one for the links between classes, :math:`\\gamma_{01}`.
    Then the formulation would be

    .. math:: Q = \\sum_{ij}
       [A_{ij}
        - (\\gamma_0\\delta(s_i,0) + \\gamma_1\\delta(s_i,1)) \\delta(s_i,s_j)
        - \\gamma_{01}(1 - \\delta(s_i, s_j))
       ]\\delta(\\sigma_i, \\sigma_j)

    In terms of communities this is

    .. math:: Q = \\sum_c (e_c
                          - \\gamma_{01} 2 n_c(0) n_c(1)
                          - \\gamma_0 n^2_c(0)
                          - \\gamma_1 n^2_c(1))

    where :math:`n_c(0)` is the number of nodes in community :math:`c` of class 0
    (and similarly for 1) and :math:`e_c` is the number of edges within community
    :math:`c`. We denote by :math:`n_c = n_c(0) + n_c(1)` the total number of nodes
    in community :math:`c`.

    We achieve this by creating three layers : (1) all nodes have ``node_size =
    1`` and all relevant links; (2) only nodes of class 0 have ``node_size =
    1`` and no links; (3) only nodes of class 1 have ``node_size = 1`` and no
    links. If we add the first with resolution parameter :math:`\\gamma_{01}`,
    and the others with resolution parameters :math:`\\gamma_{01} - \\gamma_0`
    and :math:`\\gamma_{01} - \\gamma_1`, but the latter two with a layer
    weight of -1 while the first layer has layer weight 1, we obtain the
    following:

    .. math:: Q &=  \\sum_c (e_c - \\gamma_{01} n_c^2)
                   -\\sum_c (- (\\gamma_{01} - \\gamma_0) n_c(0)^2)
                   -\\sum_c (- (\\gamma_{01} - \\gamma_1) n_c(1)^2) \\\\
                &=  \\sum_c [e_c - \\gamma_{01} 2 n_c(0) n_c(1)
                                 - \\gamma_{01} n_c(0)^2
                                 - \\gamma_{01} n_c(1)^2)
                                 + ( \\gamma_{01} - \\gamma_0) n_c(0)^2
                                 + ( \\gamma_{01} - \\gamma_1) n_c(1)^2
                           ] \\\\
                &=  \\sum_c [e_c - \\gamma_{01} 2 n_c(0) n_c(1)
                                 - \\gamma_{0} n_c(0)^2
                                 - \\gamma_{1} n_c(1)^2]

    Although the derivation above is using :math:`n_c^2`, implicitly assuming a
    direct graph with self-loops, similar derivations can be made for
    undirected graphs using :math:`\\binom{n_c}{2}`, but the notation is then
    somewhat more convoluted.

    If we set node sizes equal to the degree, we get something similar to
    modularity, except that the resolution parameter should still be divided by
    :math:`2m`. In particular, in general (i.e. not specifically for bipartite
    graph) if ``node_sizes=G.degree()`` we then obtain

    .. math:: Q = \\sum_{ij} A_{ij} - \\gamma k_i k_j

    In the case of bipartite graphs something similar is obtained, but then
    correctly adapted (as long as the resolution parameter is also
    appropriately rescaled).

    .. note:: This function is not suited for directed graphs in the case of
              using the degree as node sizes.

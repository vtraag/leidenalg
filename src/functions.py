  Parameters
  ----------
  graph : :class:`ig.Graph`
    The graph for which to detect communities.

  partition_type : type of :class:`
    The type of partition to use for optimisation.

  initial_membership : list of int
    Initial membership for the partition. If :obj:`None` then defaults to a
    singleton partition.

  weights : list of double, or edge attribute
    Weights of edges. Can be either an iterable or an edge attribute.

  n_iterations : int
    Number of iterations to run the Leiden algorithm. By default, 2 iterations

  This function converts a graph of slices to layers so that they can be used

  nodes in ``G_coupling``, and stored in the attribute ``slice_attr``. In other
  words, ``G_coupling.vs[slice_attr]`` should contain :class:`ig.Graph` s . The
  slices will be converted to layers, and nodes in different slices will be
  coupled if the two slices are connected in ``G_coupling``. Nodes in two
  connected slices are identified on the basis of the ``vertex_id_attr``, i.e.
  if two nodes in two connected slices have an identical value of the
  ``vertex_id_attr`` they will be coupled. The ``vertex_id_attr`` should hence
  be unique in each slice.  The weight of the coupling is determined by the
  weight of this link in ``G_coupling``, as determined by the ``weight_attr``.

  Parameters
  ----------
  G_coupling : :class:`ig.Graph`
    The graph connecting the different slices.

  slice_attr : string
    The vertex attribute which contains the slices.

  vertex_id_attr : string
    The vertex attribute which is used to identify whether two nodes in two
    slices represent the same node, and hence, should be coupled.

  edge_type_attr : string
    The edge attribute to use for indicating the type of link (``interslice``
    or ``intraslice``).

  weight_attr : string
    The edge attribute used to indicate the (coupling) weight.

  Returns
  -------
  G_layers : list of :class:`ig.Graph`
    A list of slices converted to layers.

  G_interslice : :class:`ig.Graph`
    The interslice coupling layer.

  G : :class:`ig.Graph`
    The complete graph containing all layers and interslice couplings.

  Notes
  -----
  The distinction between slices and layers is not easy to grasp. Slices in
  this context refer to graphs that somehow represents different aspects of a
  network. The simplest example is probably slices that represents time: there
  are different snapshots network across time, and each snapshot is considered
  a slice. Some nodes may drop out of the network over time, while others enter
  the network. Edges may change over time, or the weight of the links may
  change over time. This is just the simplest example of a slice, and there may
  be different, more complex possibilities. Below an example with three time
  slices:

  .. image:: figures/slices.png

  Now in order to optimise partitions across these different slices, we
  represent them slightly differently, namely as layers. The idea of layers is
  that all graphs always are defined on the same set of nodes, and that only the
  links differ for different layers. We thus create new nodes as combinations of
  original nodes and slices. For example, if node 1 existed in both slice 1 and
  in slice 2, we will thus create two nodes to build the layers: a node 1-1 and
  a node 1-2. Additionally, if the slices are connected in the slice graph, the
  two nodes would also be connected, so there would be a linke between node 1-1
  and 1-2. Different slices will then correspond to different layers: each layer
  only contains the link for that particular slice. In addition, for methods
  such as :class:`CPMVertexPartition`, so-called ``node_sizes`` are required,
  and for them to properly function, they should be set to 1 only for nodes of a
  layer that represent nodes of the corresponding slice and 0 for the other
  nodes (which is handled appropriately in this function, and stored in the
  vertex attribute ``node_size``). Additionally, ``node_sizes`` should be set to
  0 for the interslice coupling layer. We thus obtain equally many layers as we
  have slices, and we need one more layer for representing the interslice
  couplings.  For the example provided above, we thus obtain the following:

  .. image:: figures/layers_separate.png

  The idea of doing community detection with slices is further detailed in [1].

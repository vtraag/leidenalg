class Optimiser(object):
  """ Class for doing community detection using the Leiden algorithm.

  The Leiden algorithm [1] derives from the Louvain algorithm [2]. The Louvain
  algorithm has an elegant formulation. It consists of two phases: (1) move
  nodes between communities; (2) aggregate the graph. It then repeats these
  phases on the aggregate graph. The Leiden algorithm consists of three phases:
  (1) move nodes; (2) refine communities; (3) aggregate the graph based on the
  refinement. The Louvain algorithm can lead to arbitrarily badly connected
  communities, whereas the Leiden algorithm guarantees communities are
  well-connected. In fact, it converges towards a partition in which all
  subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Finally, the
  Leiden algorithm is also much faster, because it relies on a fast local move
  routine.

  There is one, rather technical, difference with the original Leiden
  algorithm. This implementation provides a general optimisation
  routine for any quality function. There is one aspect of the original Leiden
  algorithm that cannot be translated well in this framework: when merging
  subcommunities in the refinement procedure, it does not consider whether they
  are sufficiently well connected to the rest of the community. This
  implementation therefore does not guarantee subpartition :math:`\gamma`-density.
  However, all other guarantees still hold:

  After each iteration
    1. :math:`\gamma`-separation
    2. :math:`\gamma`-connectivity

  After a stable iteration
    3. Node optimality
    4. Some subsets are locally optimally assigned

  Asymptotically
    5. Uniform :math:`\gamma`-density
    6. Subset optimality

  The optimiser class provides a number of different methods for optimising a
  given partition. The overall optimisation procedure
  :func:`optimise_partition` calls either :func:`move_nodes` or
  :func:`merge_nodes` (which is controlled by :attr:`optimise_routine`) then
  aggregates the graph and repeats the same procedure. Possible, indicated by
  :attr:`refine_partition` the partition is refined before aggregating, meaning
  that subsets of communities are considered for moving around. Which routine
  is used for the refinement is indicated by :attr:`refine_routine`. For
  calculating the actual improvement of moving a node (corresponding a subset
  of nodes in the aggregate graph), the code relies on
  :func:`~VertexPartition.MutableVertexPartition.diff_move` which provides
  different values for different methods (e.g. modularity or CPM). The default
  settings are consistent with the Leiden algorithm. By not doing the
  refinement, you essentially get the Louvain algorithm with a fast local move.
  Finally, the Optimiser class provides a routine to construct a
  :func:`resolution_profile` on a resolution parameter.

      Improvement in quality of combined partitions, see `Notes <#notes-multiplex>`_.


    .. _notes-multiplex:

    Notes
    -----

    This method assumes that the partitions are defined for graphs with the
    same vertices. The connections between the vertices may be different, but
    the vertices themselves should be identical. In other words, all vertices
    should have identical indices in all graphs (i.e. node `i` is assumed to be
    the same node in all graphs). The quality of the overall partition is
    simply the sum of the individual qualities for the various partitions,
    weighted by the layer_weight. If we denote by :math:`Q_k` the quality of
    layer :math:`k` and the weight by :math:`\\lambda_k`, the overall quality
    is then

    .. math:: Q = \sum_k \\lambda_k Q_k.

    This is particularly useful for graphs containing negative links. When
    separating the graph in two graphs, the one containing only the positive
    links, and the other only the negative link, by supplying a negative weight
    to the latter layer, we try to find relatively many positive links within a
    community and relatively many negative links between communities. Note that
    in this case it may be better to assign a node to a community to which it
    is not connected so that :attr:`consider_comms` may be better set to
    :attr:`leidenalg.ALL_COMMS`.

    Besides multiplex graphs where each node is assumed to have a single
    community, it is also useful in the case of for example multiple time
    slices, or in situations where nodes can have different communities in
    different slices. The package includes some special helper functions for
    using :func:`optimise_partition_multiplex` in such cases, where there is a
    conversion required from (time) slices to layers suitable for use in this
    function.

      The type of :class:`~VertexPartition.MutableVertexPartition` used

    list of :class:`~VertexPartition.MutableVertexPartition`
      A list of partitions for different resolutions.

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    bisect_func
      The function used for bisectioning. For the methods currently
      implemented, this should usually not be altered.

    min_diff_bisect_value
      The difference in the value returned by the bisect_func below which the
      bisectioning stops (i.e. by default, a difference of a single edge does
      not trigger further bisectioning).

    min_diff_resolution
      The difference in resolution below which the bisectioning stops. For
      positive differences, the logarithmic difference is used by default, i.e.
      ``diff = log(res_1) - log(res_2) = log(res_1/res_2)``, for which ``diff >
      min_diff_resolution`` to continue bisectioning. Set the linear_bisection
      to true in order to use only linear bisectioning (in the case of negative
      resolution parameters for example, which can happen with negative
      weights).

    linear_bisection
      Whether the bisectioning will be done on a linear or on a logarithmic
      basis (if possible).

    number_iterations
      Indicates the number of iterations of the algorithm to run. If negative
      (or zero) the algorithm is run until a stable iteration.
